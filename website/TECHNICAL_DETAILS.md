## Architecture

### System Overview

Whambam follows a worker pool architecture with lock-free metrics collection, providing a high-performance solution for load testing HTTP endpoints. The system is composed of several key components:

1. **Command Parser**: Processes user inputs to configure the test parameters
2. **Unified Test Runner**: Coordinates the overall test execution
3. **Worker Pool**: Manages concurrent request execution with individual worker threads
4. **Metrics Collection**: Lock-free metrics gathering and analysis
5. **Interactive UI**: Real-time visualization of test progress and results

### Data Flow

```
User Input → Command Parser → Test Config → Unified Runner → Worker Pool → HTTP Requests
                                                ↑                               ↓
                                            UI Display ← Metrics Collection ← Request Results
```

### Worker Pool Design

The core of Whambam's performance lies in its worker pool implementation. Instead of traditional thread pools that might experience contention under high load, Whambam uses an asynchronous task-based approach with Tokio:

```rust
pub struct WorkerPool {
    client: Client,
    job_sender: mpsc::Sender<RequestJob>,
    worker_handles: Vec<tokio::task::JoinHandle<()>>,
    is_running: Arc<AtomicBool>,
}

impl WorkerPool {
    pub fn new(
        client: Client,
        concurrency: usize,
        metric_sender: mpsc::Sender<RequestMetric>,
        is_running: Arc<AtomicBool>,
        rate_limit: f64,
    ) -> Self {
        // Create a channel for distributing jobs
        let (job_sender, job_receiver) = mpsc::channel::<RequestJob>(concurrency * 2);
        
        // Share the job receiver among workers
        let job_receiver = Arc::new(tokio::sync::Mutex::new(job_receiver));
        
        // Create worker tasks
        let mut worker_handles = Vec::with_capacity(concurrency);
        
        for _ in 0..concurrency {
            // Create worker task
            // ...
            worker_handles.push(handle);
        }
        
        WorkerPool {
            client,
            job_sender,
            worker_handles,
            is_running,
        }
    }
}
```

Each worker independently processes requests, allowing for maximum utilization of system resources. The architecture minimizes contention by:

1. Using a shared job receiver with a mutex
2. Processing metrics asynchronously via channels
3. Employing lock-free data structures for statistics

## Performance Optimizations

### Lock-Free Metrics Collection

One of the most significant performance bottlenecks in high-throughput load testing is metrics collection. Whambam implements a lock-free metrics system using atomic operations and concurrent queues:

```rust
pub struct LockFreeMetrics {
    // Atomic counters for frequently updated simple metrics
    completed_requests: AtomicUsize,
    error_count: AtomicUsize,
    bytes_sent: AtomicU64,
    bytes_received: AtomicU64,
    
    // Concurrent queue for incoming metrics
    metrics_queue: Arc<SegQueue<RequestMetric>>,
    
    // These are updated less frequently and can use a lightweight RwLock
    status_counts: Arc<PLRwLock<HashMap<u16, usize>>>,
    
    // Histogram for latency calculations
    latency_histogram: Arc<RwLock<Histogram<u64>>>,
    
    // Derived statistics calculated periodically
    min_latency: AtomicU64,
    max_latency: AtomicU64,
    p50_latency: AtomicU64,
    p90_latency: AtomicU64,
    p95_latency: AtomicU64,
    p99_latency: AtomicU64,
    
    // Additional state...
}
```

Key optimizations in the metrics collection:

1. **Atomic Counters**: Frequently updated values use atomic operations instead of locks
2. **Lock-Free Queues**: Metrics are queued using `SegQueue` from `crossbeam-queue`
3. **Batched Processing**: Metrics are processed in batches rather than individually
4. **Two-Phase Updates**: Simple counters are updated immediately, while more complex statistics are calculated periodically

### HTTP Client Optimization

The HTTP client is configured for optimal performance in high-throughput scenarios:

```rust
fn create_http_client(config: &TestConfig) -> Client {
    let mut client_builder = Client::builder();
    
    // Configure options based on user preferences
    // ...
    
    // Optimize connection pooling
    client_builder = client_builder
        .pool_max_idle_per_host(config.concurrent * 2)
        .pool_idle_timeout(Duration::from_secs(300))
        .tcp_keepalive(Duration::from_secs(60));
    
    client_builder.build().unwrap_or_else(|_| {
        // Fallback to default client
        Client::new()
    })
}
```

Notable optimizations include:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections to avoid TCP handshake overhead
2. **TCP Keep-Alive**: Maintain connections to improve throughput
3. **Idle Connection Management**: Optimize resource usage while maintaining performance

### Efficient Histogram Implementation

Latency statistics are calculated using HDRHistogram, which provides accurate percentile measurements with minimal overhead:

```rust
// Recording a metric
let latency_as_u64 = (metric.latency_ms * 1000.0) as u64;
if let Ok(mut hist) = self.latency_histogram.write() {
    let _ = hist.record(latency_as_u64);
}

// Updating percentiles
if let Ok(hist) = self.latency_histogram.read() {
    let p50 = hist.value_at_quantile(0.5) as u64;
    let p90 = hist.value_at_quantile(0.9) as u64;
    let p95 = hist.value_at_quantile(0.95) as u64;
    let p99 = hist.value_at_quantile(0.99) as u64;
    
    self.p50_latency.store(p50, Ordering::Relaxed);
    self.p90_latency.store(p90, Ordering::Relaxed);
    self.p95_latency.store(p95, Ordering::Relaxed);
    self.p99_latency.store(p99, Ordering::Relaxed);
}
```

## Technology Stack

Whambam leverages several key Rust crates to achieve its performance goals:

### Core Dependencies

- **tokio**: Asynchronous runtime for concurrent operations
- **reqwest**: HTTP client with performance optimization options
- **ratatui + crossterm**: Terminal UI framework for interactive display
- **hdrhistogram**: Efficient latency percentile tracking
- **parking_lot**: High-performance synchronization primitives
- **crossbeam-queue**: Lock-free concurrent queues

### Asynchronous Processing

The application is built on Tokio's async runtime, allowing it to:

1. Execute thousands of concurrent HTTP requests with minimal overhead
2. Process responses without blocking threads
3. Coordinate metrics collection and UI updates efficiently

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Application initialization and execution
    // ...
}
```

### Memory Efficiency

Rust's ownership model and zero-cost abstractions allow Whambam to achieve high performance with minimal memory overhead. The application:

1. Reuses buffers where possible
2. Avoids unnecessary copies of request/response data
3. Uses efficient data structures for metrics collection

## Core Components

### Unified Runner

The `UnifiedRunner` coordinates the overall test execution:

```rust
pub struct UnifiedRunner {
    config: TestConfig,
    metrics: SharedMetrics,
    shared_state: Option<SharedState>,
    is_running: Arc<AtomicBool>,
    tx: mpsc::Sender<Message>,
    rx: mpsc::Receiver<Message>,
}
```

Key responsibilities:
1. Creating and managing the worker pool
2. Setting up metrics collection
3. Coordinating the start and stop of tests
4. Reporting results

### Worker Pool Implementation

The worker loop demonstrates how requests are processed efficiently:

```rust
async fn worker_loop(
    client: Client,
    job_receiver: Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<RequestJob>>>,
    metric_sender: mpsc::Sender<RequestMetric>,
    is_running: Arc<AtomicBool>,
    sem: Arc<tokio::sync::Semaphore>,
    rate_limit: f64,
) {
    while is_running.load(Ordering::SeqCst) {
        // Get the next job
        let job = {
            let mut receiver = job_receiver.lock().await;
            match receiver.recv().await {
                Some(job) => job,
                None => break,
            }
        };

        // Apply rate limiting if configured
        if rate_limit > 0.0 {
            let delay_ms = (1000.0 / rate_limit) as u64;
            tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay_ms)).await;
        }

        // Acquire a permit from the semaphore
        let _permit = sem.acquire().await.unwrap();

        // Execute the request
        let result = Self::execute_request(
            &client,
            job.url,
            job.method,
            &job.headers,
            job.body,
            job.basic_auth,
            job.timeout,
            job.start_time,
        )
        .await;

        // Send the result metric
        let _ = metric_sender.send(result).await;
    }
}
```

### Lock-Free Metrics Recording

The metrics recording path is optimized for minimal contention:

```rust
pub fn record(&self, metric: &RequestMetric) {
    // Increment atomic counters immediately
    self.completed_requests.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    self.bytes_sent.fetch_add(metric.bytes_sent, Ordering::Relaxed);
    self.bytes_received.fetch_add(metric.bytes_received, Ordering::Relaxed);

    // Update error count if needed
    if metric.is_error {
        self.error_count.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    }

    // Update min/max latency using compare_exchange
    let latency_as_u64 = (metric.latency_ms * 1000.0) as u64;

    // Update min latency with compare_exchange loop
    let mut current_min = self.min_latency.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    while latency_as_u64 < current_min {
        match self.min_latency.compare_exchange(
            current_min,
            latency_as_u64,
            Ordering::Relaxed,
            Ordering::Relaxed,
        ) {
            Ok(_) => break,
            Err(x) => current_min = x,
        }
    }

    // Queue the metric for batch processing
    self.metrics_queue.push(metric.clone());

    // Periodically process the queued metrics
    let completed = self.completed_requests.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    if completed % 100 == 0 {
        self.process_queued_metrics();
        self.update_statistics();
    }
}
```

## UI Implementation

Whambam features an interactive terminal UI built with Ratatui and Crossterm. The UI is designed to:

1. Display real-time metrics with minimal impact on test performance
2. Provide different views of test results (summary, detailed statistics)
3. Allow user interaction during test execution

```rust
pub fn run(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
    // Set up terminal
    enable_raw_mode()?;
    let mut stdout = io::stdout();
    execute!(stdout, EnterAlternateScreen, EnableMouseCapture)?;
    let backend = CrosstermBackend::new(stdout);
    let mut terminal = Terminal::new(backend)?;

    // Start the event loop
    let tick_rate = Duration::from_millis(100);
    let mut last_tick = Instant::now();

    loop {
        // Minimize the time we hold the lock - get a snapshot of the state
        let should_quit;

        {
            // CRITICAL: Lock for as little time as possible to avoid blocking the test runner
            let app_state = self.shared_state.state.lock().unwrap();

            // Just render with the current state snapshot
            terminal.draw(|f| ui(f, &app_state, &self.ui_state))?;

            // Store quit value for checking later
            should_quit = app_state.should_quit;
        }

        // Handle events, check for exit conditions
        // ...
    }
}
```

Key UI optimizations:
1. Short-duration locks to avoid impacting test performance
2. Periodic updates rather than continuous rendering
3. Separate UI thread from test execution
